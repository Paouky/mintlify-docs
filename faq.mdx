<Accordion title="Is Lightcone a futarchy protocol?">
  you may have heard this before, so let's clarify: While Lightcone _is_ inspired by the mechanism which underlies futarchy, our use of it is for a completely different purpose. We are not a futarchy product.
  
  While we are not in any way a fork, we do thank MetaDAO for introducing the primitive / implementing it for the first time. Their contribution to the world is immeasurable.

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
  ```
