  <Accordion title="Is Lightcone a Futarchy protocol?">
  <div className="text-white">
    Let's clarify: While Lightcone _is_ inspired by the mechanism which underlies Futarchy, our use of it is for an utterly different purpose -- therefore, we're not a Futarchy product.
    <br /><br />
    While we are not in any way a fork, we do thank MetaDAO for introducing the primitive / implementing it for the first time. Their contribution to the world is immeasurable.
