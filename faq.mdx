### Is Lightcone a Futarchy protocol?

Let's clarify: While Lightcone _is_ inspired by the mechanism which underlies Futarchy, our use of it is for an utterly different purpose -- therefore, we're not a Futarchy protocol.

<Accordion title="Wtf is Futarchy?" iconType="regular">
  <div className="w-36 h-36 rounded-lg">
  <img
    src="/Screenshot2025-08-26at3.48.25PM.png"
    alt="Hello sir do you have a moment to talk about futarchy"
    className="w-full h-full object-contain"
    title="Hello sir do you have a moment to talk about futarchy"
  />

  </div>

  While we are not in any way a fork, we do thank MetaDAO for introducing
  the primitive / implementing it for the first time. Their contribution to
  the world is immeasurable.
